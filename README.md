##  Overview

This Python script automates **firmware rollouts using the Eclipse Hawkbit REST API**.  
It reads rollout configuration dynamically from a JSON file (`config.json`) and supports multiple firmware sequences such as `1.0`, `1.1`, or `0.9`.

It handles:
- Creation and update of **target filters**
- Automated **rollout creation**, start, and monitoring
- Retrieval of **assigned** and **installed** firmware
- Display of **firmware history** (all previously installed distributions)
- Configurable polling intervals and timeouts

---

##  Features

- **Config-Driven:** Firmware names, versions, and sequences are loaded from `config.json`.
- **Automatic Target Filtering:** Serial numbers in a CSV file define rollout targets.
- **Rollout Monitoring:** Displays live rollout progress until completion.
- **Firmware Verification:** Checks both assigned and installed DS per target.
- **Firmware History:** Lists all previously installed firmware versions from Hawkbit.
- **Clean Logging:** Fully timestamped and consistent with Hawkbitâ€™s REST conventions.
